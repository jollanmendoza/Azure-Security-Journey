# Azure and GRC Learning Journey

## Certification Roadmap
- [ ] AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals (Target: January 2026)
- [ ] SC-900: Security, Compliance, and Identity (Target: Febuary 2026)

## Daily Learning Log

### Day 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

**Date:** December 30, 2025

**Focus:** Cloud Fundalmentals & GRC Enviroment Setup

- [x] **Portfolio Infrastructure:** Created GitHub Repository `Azure-Security-Journey` and initialized documentation structure.
- [x] **GRC Tracking:** Configured Notion Database for AZ-900/SC-900 exam tracking and terminology management.
- [x] **Shared Responsibility Model:** Created a comprehensive responsibility matrix for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS service models.
- [x] **Key Takeaway:** Understood that regardless of the cloud model, the consumer is always responsible for Data, Identities, and Devices.

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `README.md` (Progress Log)
- `cloud-fundamentals.md`
- `shared-responsibility.md`

### Day 2: Management Tools & Active Recall System

**Date:** January 12, 2026

**Focus:** Azure Interaction Methods & Active Recall Integration

- [x] **Active Recall System:** Within my Notion database, I created the "Active Recall: Responsibility Matrix" table. This table maps concepts across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS to identify ownership (Consumer, Provider, or Shared)
- [x] **Glossary Infrastructure:** Within the same Notion database, I configured a second Notion Table for Terminology & Concept Tracking (Updated Version of Day 1 **GRC Tracking**). Which includes:
  - **Service/Concept Name**
  - **Exam Tracking (AZ-900/SC-900)**
  - **Learning Status**
  - **GitHub Linkage:** Direct links back to the Azure-Security-Journey repository for integrated documentation.
- [x] **Interaction Mastery:** Documented the primary methods for interacting with Azure, specifically the Azure Portal (GUI) and the Command Line Interface (CLI).
- [x] Key Takeaways: Linking Notion status tracking directly to Github documentation creates a closed-loop learning system, ensuring no terminology gaps before exam days.

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `README.md` (Progress Log)
- `azure-architecture.md`
