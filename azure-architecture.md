# Azure Architecture

## What is Azure and What does it Provide?
Azure is a expanding set of cloud services that help meet current/future buisness challenges. Azure provides the user the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using well known tools and frameworks.

- **Azure Provides Limitless Innovation:** Allows users to build intelligent apps and solutions with advanced technology, tools, and services to elevate your buisness.
- **Brings Ideas to Life:** Develop on a trusted platform to advance your organization with industry-leading AI and cloud services.
- **Seamlessly Unify:** Efficently manage all your infrastructure, data, analytics, and AI solutions across an integrated platform.
- **Innovate On Trust:** Rely on trusted technology from a partner who's dedicated to security and responsibility.

## Interaction With Azure
**Azure Portal:** provides a graphic user interface (GUI) to interact with Azure services which include:
- Different service areas.
- Manage subscriptions & accounts.
- Search for specific services/settings.

Azure Portal allows for the usage of command line interface (CLI) with Powershell and BASH commands. The user also can switch between using either Powershell or BASH commands in a click of a button. When in Powershell mode, the command line starts with PS (PowerShell), and when in BASH mode, the command line starts with your username@azure.

**Most Azure specific commands begin with the letters az. (For both Powershell & BASH).**

**Azure CLI Interactive Mode:** This changes behavior to more resemble an integrated development enviroment. This mode provides autocompletion, command descriptions, and examples which is perfect for beginners who aren't used to using Powershell or BASH but want to still use the command line. (az interactive is the command to enter this mode).
