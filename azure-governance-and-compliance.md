# Azure Management and Governance

Azure shifts development costs from the capital expense (CapEx) of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an operational expense (OpEx) of rening infrastructure as you need, whether it's compute, storage, network, or any other needs.

**OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors:**
- Resource Type
- Consumption
- Maintenance
- Geography
- Subscription Type
- Azure Marketplace
