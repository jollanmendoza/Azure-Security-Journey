# Azure Management and Governance

Azure shifts development costs from the capital expense (CapEx) of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an operational expense (OpEx) of renting infrastructure as you need, whether it's compute, storage, network, or any other needs.

**OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors:**
- Resource Type
- Consumption
- Maintenance
- Geography
- Subscription Type
- Azure Marketplace

## Resource Type

Multiple factors influence the cost of Azure resources. The type of resource, the settings of the resource, and the Azure region will have a impact on how much a resource costs. When provisioning an Azure resource, Azure creates a metered instances for that resource and it will track that resources' usage and generate a usage record that can be used to caculate the bill.

## Consumption
