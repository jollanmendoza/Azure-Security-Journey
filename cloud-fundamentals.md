# Cloud Fundamentals

## Core Definition
**Cloud Computing:** Delivery of computing services over the internet which include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. 

## Cloud Deployment Models
- **Private Cloud:** A cloud service used by a single entity.
- **Public Cloud:** A cloud built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud service provider.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** A computing environment that uses both private and public clouds in an interconnected environment.
- **Multi-Cloud:** A scenario where an organization uses multiple public cloud providers (e.g., Azure and AWS). 

## Key Comparative Aspects Between Cloud Models
| Private Cloud | Public Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Organizations have complete control over both resources and security. | No capital expenditures (CapEx) to scale up. | Provides the most flexibility for diverse workloads. |
| Data is not collocated with other organizations' data. | Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned. | Organizations determine exactly where to run their applications. |
| Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance. | Organizations pay only for what they utilize (OpEx). | Organizations maintain control over specific security or legal requirements. |
| Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates. | Organizations do not have complete control over underlying hardware. | Supports **"Cloud Bursting"** to handle heavy spikes of traffic using public resources. |

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **High Availability:** Ability to keep a system up and running for a long period (minimal downtime) even if components fail.
- **Scalability:** The ability to handle increases in demand.
    - **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing the "power" of an existing server (adding RAM/CPU).
    - **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more servers (instances) to share the load.
- **Elasticity:** The ability to automatically scale resources (up or down) dynamically based on real-time demand.
- **Reliability:** The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
- **Predictability:**
    - **Performance:** Ensuring the speed and quality of the service remains consistent.
    - **Cost:** Being able to forecast and track cloud spend accurately.
- **Security & Governance:** Using built-in cloud tools to ensure the environment meets compliance standards.

## Cloud Economics
- **Consumption-Based Model:** Only pay for the resources you utilize.
- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** One-time, upfront expenditure to purchase or secure physical infrastructure.
- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):** Ongoing spending on services or products over time.
