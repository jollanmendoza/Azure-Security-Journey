# Shared Responsibility Model

## Definition
The Shared Responsibility Model is a framework that identifies which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider (Microsoft) and which tasks are handled by the consumer (You). 

## Cloud Services Models
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
**Software as a Service (SaaS):** Places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. 
**Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Being the middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, this rests in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.

## Shared Responsibility Table
This table informs who is responsible for what, depending on the clooud service type.
